<p>I&rsquo;m a part-time comedian to a captivating stubborn red Pembroke Welsh Corgi
named Ginger, full-time iOS developer, and master of multitasking between
family and Swift syntax.</p>
<img src="/images/Ginger.jpg" alt="Ginger">
<p>My journey as an iOS developer began in 2013 when I had to make an app for
pedestrians with routing features as part of my Masters project.
Learning Objective-C in just three months was tough, but I fell in
love with app development right away.</p>
<p>After graduation, I made an expense-tracking app called &ldquo;My Cost&rdquo;. I maintained
it for a while until I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focusing
on finding anomalies in big data using neural networks.</p>
<p>Throughout my tenure as a freelance iOS developer, I had the privilege of
collaborating with various companies, taking <a href="/projects/">projects</a> from
conception to completion. Each app <a href="/projects/">listed</a> represents a culmination
of my skills, creativity, and dedication to delivering high-quality mobile
experiences. While I&rsquo;ve moved on from contractor work, the responsibility for
maintaining these apps now rests with other developers.</p>
<p>In 2020, I made the leap to become a full-time iOS developer and joined
<a href="https://www.neofinancial.com">Neo Financial</a>, a company dedicated to
revolutionizing the banking experience for Canadians. After almost five
years, in 2025, I decided to seek a new challenge; therefore, joined the Platform
team at <a href="https://www.thescore.com">theScore</a>.</p>
