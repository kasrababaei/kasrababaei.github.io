      <title>Mutual Inclusion by Swift Concurrency</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization refers to the coordination of multiple threads of execution.&#xA;When accessing a shared object, it involves mechanisms to manage mutual&#xA;exclusion—where only one thread can access a critical section at a time—and&#xA;mutual inclusion—where multiple threads can access resources concurrently when&#xA;safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While using a mutex/lock makes it possible to provide exclusive access to a&#xA;shared mutable state/object, this mutual exclusion isn&amp;rsquo;t always ideal. In some&#xA;cases, multiple threads should be allowed to access the shared state as long&#xA;as some condition is valid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 in Review</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the year comes to an end, I find it’s the perfect time to reflect on&#xA;my accomplishments and contributions in 2024. The year brought unexpected&#xA;twists, such as leaving &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.neofinancial.com&#34;&gt;Neo Financial&lt;/a&gt; and&#xA;embracing new challenges at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thescore.com&#34;&gt;theScore&lt;/a&gt;. While&#xA;I achieved several of my goals, a few others remain on my list for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most unforeseen and significant changes in 2024 was&#xA;my decision to leave Neo. I joined Neo Financial in early 2020, becoming&#xA;part of the iOS team alongside another developer, just one month apart.&#xA;I had the privilege of contributing to the team so early that I was&#xA;there to celebrate its very first release. Over nearly five years,&#xA;I truly enjoyed working with a team of&#xA;exceptionally talented engineers who dedicated their days and nights to&#xA;delivering a groundbreaking product, revolutionizing the banking experience&#xA;for Canadians. However, as difficult as it was, I began reflecting on my&#xA;personal goals and growth trajectory. Seeking a new project that would&#xA;push my boundaries and expose me to fresh challenges, I decided to&#xA;join the Platform team at &lt;em&gt;theScore&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adding a System-Wide Git Logger on macOS</title>
      <link>https://kasrababaei.com/posts/log-git-commands/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is both simple and, at times, complicated. While it&amp;rsquo;s initially encouraged to use the command line instead of apps like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.git-tower.com&#34;&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-fork.com&#34;&gt;Fork&lt;/a&gt;, which offer a user-friendly interface, these apps can sometimes boost productivity. For instance, they provide a visual representation of branches and convenient ways to perform tasks like cloning, pulling, cherry-picking, and rebasing. However, not all of them offer a log or console to monitor the Git commands being executed behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was very excited to join a small group of software engineers (I might be wrong, but I vaguely remember being among the first 25). At that time, the iOS team consisted of two people (one of whom was hired just a few weeks before me). Even though the workload was very high and, due to COVID-19, we had to deal with occasional lockdowns, I had a great experience and was learning at an incredible pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
