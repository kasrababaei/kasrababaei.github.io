<p>My journey at <a href="https://www.neofinancial.com">Neo Financial</a> started in March 2020. I was very excited to join a small group of software engineers (I might be wrong, but I vaguely remember being among the first 25). At that time, the iOS team consisted of two people (one of whom was hired just a few weeks before me). Even though the workload was very high and, due to COVID-19, we had to deal with occasional lockdowns, I had a great experience and was learning at an incredible pace.</p>
<p>At Neo, we use <a href="https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen">XcodeGen</a> for project management (I actually prefer <a href="https://github.com/tuist/tuist">Tuist</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t available at the time). In most cases, we try to follow the MVVM architecture and use Coordinators for managing navigation. I remember that during my onboarding, one of the first things I needed to learn was a new dependency injection approach called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA9rGQRwHGs">Indirected Instantiation</a>, which was introduced by the engineering team at Lyft. Just like many things, once you learn it, you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine">Combine</a> framework wasn&rsquo;t released until 2019, the team decided to create its own APIs for handling asynchronous events. We call it <code>Signal</code>. Without getting into the implementation details, let&rsquo;s just say the rationale behind it was that we needed a few simple operators, full control over the codebase, and, after all, it&rsquo;s a banking app, so we prefer to avoid third-party frameworks as much as possible. Even though <code>Signal</code> never showed poor performance or bugs, many new hires struggled to learn it. At the time, we didn&rsquo;t have proper documentation for it, and since it&rsquo;s not publicly available, developers couldn&rsquo;t just Google it themselves. That&rsquo;s why, after a while, we started shifting towards <code>Combine</code> (though there&rsquo;s still some <code>Signal</code> left to clean up).</p>
<p>We also use <a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://www.apollographql.com">Apollo</a> for exchanging data with our backend. It&rsquo;s great that developers only need to write the query, and then <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios-codegen">Apollo Codegen</a> generates the code for you. I just hope they can pick up the pace and release a version that supports <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrency/">Swift Concurrency</a> and offers async functions.</p>
<p>Most of our app is built using UIKit; however, we&rsquo;re slowly transitioning towards SwiftUI. Another thing we&rsquo;re working on is updating our 100+ modules to adopt Swift 6! Oh boy, that is not easy&hellip;</p>
