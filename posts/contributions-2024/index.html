<p>As the year comes to an end, I find it’s the perfect time to reflect on
my accomplishments and contributions in 2024. The year brought unexpected
twists, such as leaving <a href="https://www.neofinancial.com">Neo Financial</a> and
embracing new challenges at <a href="https://www.thescore.com">theScore</a>. While
I achieved several of my goals, a few others remain on my list for the future.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most unforeseen and significant changes in 2024 was
my decision to leave Neo. I joined Neo Financial in early 2020, becoming
part of the iOS team alongside another developer, just one month apart.
I had the privilege of contributing to the team so early that I was
there to celebrate its very first release. Over nearly five years,
I truly enjoyed working with a team of
exceptionally talented engineers who dedicated their days and nights to
delivering a groundbreaking product, revolutionizing the banking experience
for Canadians. However, as difficult as it was, I began reflecting on my
personal goals and growth trajectory. Seeking a new project that would
push my boundaries and expose me to fresh challenges, I decided to
join the Platform team at <em>theScore</em>.</p>
<p>Beyond joining a new team, I ventured into blogging, launched a few side
projects, and dedicated considerable time and effort to deepening my understanding
of Swift Concurrency and SwiftUI. In fact, I’m excited to soon publish a new post
on using <code>Actor</code> and <code>Task</code> to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)#Condition_variables_2">Condition Variable</a>.</p>

<p>One area where I fell short was maintaining a consistent blogging schedule.
In 2025, I plan to commit to posting at least one blog every 2–3 months. While
I contributed to some public projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/5437">SwiftLint</a>,
I believe there’s still room for me to be more active in the open-source community.</p>
<p>Overall, 2024 was a year of growth and learning. I delved into complex
topics like data synchronization, handling data races, and leveraging
Swift Concurrency to address these challenges. Additionally, I began
incorporating my side projects, written in SwiftUI, into production
apps, which presented new opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2025, I aim to explore the new Swift Testing framework,
macros that are becoming integral to the language, and foundational
concepts such as inlining methods in Swift. I’m excited to continue
pushing my limits and expanding my expertise in the year to come.</p>
